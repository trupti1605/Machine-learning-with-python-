### Introduction 
In this capstone project I built a classifier to predict whether a loan will be paid or not.
In this project we are expected to use the following algorithm to build model

1)K-NN

2)Decision Tree 

3)SVM 

4)Logistic Regression 

The result is reported as the accuracy of each classifier,using the following metrics when these are applicable:-

i)Jaccard index 

ii)F1-score

iii)Logloss

- The best classifier will be 

  1)Building model using KNN, finding the best known and accuracy evaluation.

  2)Building model using decision tree,finding the best k and accuracy evaluation. 

  3)Building model using SVM,finding the best k and accuracy evaluation.

  4)Building model using logistic regression, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation.

- The steps for the project will be

1)Data cleaning 

2)Data visualization 

3)Applying different machine learning algorithms
