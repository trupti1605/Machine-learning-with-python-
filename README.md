### Introduction 
In this capstone project I built a classifier to predict whether a loan will be paid or not.

- The best classifier will be 
1)Building model using KNN, finding the best known and accuracy evaluation.

  2)Building model using decision tree,finding the best k and accuracy evaluation. 
  3)Building model using SVM,finding the best k and accuracy evaluation.
  4)Building model using logistic regression, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation.
- The steps for the project will be

1)Data cleaning 

2)Data visualization 

3)Applying different machine learning algorithms
